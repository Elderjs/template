One of the most popular use cases of static site generators is to build a blog.

So we figured why not offer a blog right out of the box on the starter template? 

This guide will show you how to customize your Elder.js blog.

## This Page is Editable

If you've gotten this starter template running, then chances are you know what markdown is. If you don't here is <a href="https://medium.com/@itsjzt/beginner-guide-to-markdown-229adce30074">a good beginner's guide to it.</a> 

With that out of the way, let's talk about how you'll edit pages on your blog.

To start, open up the markdown file powering this page at: `./src/routes/blog/how-to-build-a-blog-with-elderjs.md`

Once you've got it open, make some small changes, save the file and restart the server.
When you reload this page you should see your changes.


## Adding Markdown Files

Once you've edited this page, try duplicating and renaming one of the files in the `./src/routes/blog/` folder. Give the new file name anything you'd like. 

Once you've done that, restart the server (or let it restart if you are using the `npm run dev:server` command) and then navigate to the homepage. Boom! You should see your new blog entry. 

It is really that simple. 


## Customizing Your Design

Without making this guide 1000s of words long, basically all templating and design for this site is done using Svelte. 

This page is being built with a Svelte template that lives at `./src/routes/blog/Blog.svelte`. There is also a components folder at ``./src/components/` where you can add reusable components.

Svelte files in either of these locations will be bundled by the default Rollup.js included with this script. (run by typing `npm run dev:rollup`).

Customizing your design is up to you, but in general if you're comfortable with JS/CSS/HTML you'll love the beauty that Svelte brings to the development workflow.
